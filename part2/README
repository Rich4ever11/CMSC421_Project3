Program works by echoing commands (writing) into the device and then cating out (reading) the device. Once you preform a command and cat (read) the device
it will tell you the result of the move/action. (cating continuestly just repeats the same output for the result of the previous command).

List of Commands (each command sets up the *cat /dev/fourinarow* to display its specific output)

  echo "DROPC A/n" > /dev/fourinarow - drops a piece in the board. The A can be any letter from A - H. This will allow for the piece to be dropped as
  long as the space is avaliable.
  
    Result of Command After preforming cat /dev/fourinarow:
    
      -NOGAME : Displayed if the game has not been reset
      -OOT : Displayed if it is not the current user's turn
      -WIN : Displayed if the player has won
      -TIE : Displayed if there is a tie and no one has won
      -OK : Displayed if the move was successful.
  
  echo "CTURN/n" > /dev/fourinarow - Allows for the computer to take their turn. Their turn is completed randomly on any column.

    Result of Command After preforming cat /dev/fourinarow:
    
      -OK : Displayed if the reset was successful 
          (This displays even if the user enters a piece that is not R or Y - In this case the board is still reset but no player can make a move)
